Introduction

Serverless technology has become a popular choice for modern web applications due to its flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. In this document, we will explore how a React app can leverage serverless technology to implement the features described in this README.md file.

Feature 2: Show/Hide Event Details

Scenario 1: An event element is collapsed by default

Given: The app is loaded with events
When: The user views the list of events
Then: Each event element should be in a collapsed state by default

Scenario 2: User can expand an event to see details

Given: The app is loaded with events
When: The user clicks on an event element
Then: The event details should be expanded and visible

Scenario 3: User can collapse an event to hide details

Given: The event details are expanded and visible
When: The user clicks on the expanded event element
Then: The event details should be collapsed and hidden

Feature 3: Specify Number of Events

Scenario 1: When user hasn't specified a number, 32 events are shown by default

Given: The app is loaded with events
When: The user views the list of events
Then: 32 events should be displayed by default

Scenario 2: User can change the number of events displayed

Given: The app is loaded with events
When: The user specifies a different number of events to display
Then: The specified number of events should be shown

Feature 4: Use the App When Offline

Scenario 1: Show cached data when there's no internet connection

Given: The app has previously fetched event data
When: The user opens the app without an internet connection
Then: The app should display the cached event data

Scenario 2: Show error when user changes search settings (city, number of events)

Given: The app has previously fetched event data
When: The user changes the search settings (e.g., city or number of events) without an internet connection
Then: The app should display an error message indicating the need for an internet connection to make changes

Feature 5: Add an App Shortcut to the Home Screen

Scenario 1: User can install the MeetApp as a shortcut on their device home screen

Given: The user accesses the MeetApp website on a supported mobile device
When: The user adds the app to their home screen
Then: The MeetApp should be installed as a shortcut on their device's home screen

Feature 6: Display Charts Visualizing Event Details

Scenario 1: Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city

Given: The app is loaded with events
When: The user views the chart for the number of upcoming events in each city
Then: A chart displaying the event count for each city should be shown
